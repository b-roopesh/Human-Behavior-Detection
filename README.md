# Project Name: Child Safety Robot

## Description:
The Child Safety Robot project aims to create an interactive system using Raspberry Pi that educates children about good touch and bad touch while ensuring their safety through sensor-based detection and alert mechanisms.

## Software Requirements:
1. Raspberry Pi OS (or compatible Linux distribution)
2. Python (version 3.x recommended)
3. RPi.GPIO library
4. Pyttsx3 library
5. Twilio Python library
6. OpenCV (optional, for computer vision tasks)
7. SMBus library (for I2C communication)
8. Additional libraries as needed for specific sensors and hardware components
9. Development environment (e.g., Thonny IDE, Visual Studio Code)
10. Internet connectivity (optional, for online services and APIs)

## Hardware Requirements:
1. Raspberry Pi board (e.g., Raspberry Pi 4 Model B)
2. Touch sensors (placed on common touch positions)
3. Camera module (for facial recognition and gesture detection)
4. Flex sensor (for pressure detection)
5. Additional sensors and components based on project requirements
6. Power supply for Raspberry Pi and connected components

## Installation:
1. Clone or download the project repository from [GitHub](https://github.com/b-roopesh/Human-Behavior-Detection).
2. Install the required software dependencies listed in the "Software Requirements" section.
3. Connect the hardware components (sensors, camera module, etc.) to the Raspberry Pi following the provided schematics or instructions.
4. Set up the development environment on your Raspberry Pi or development machine.

## Usage:
1. Navigate to the project directory on your Raspberry Pi or development machine.
2. Run the main Python script (e.g., `main.py`) to start the Child Safety Robot application.
3. Follow on-screen instructions for interaction with the Child Safety Robot, including touch recognition practice and educational lessons.
